## My process
I started by making the repo on github and deploying the site.
Then I analyized the design and planned for the structure of Html & Css that I will use.
After that I started coding the Html and Css for mobile version. I made sure everything was working clearly.
Then I made the desktop version and it was easy for me as converting from mobile to desktop is a good method.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

More focus will be on responsive design, and tablet-version will be added soon.
